\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

  In this section, we present an initial evaluation of the performance and fault-tolerance of our algorithm.
  In \cref{sec:evaluation:correctness}, we evaluate the correctness of the results produces by our algorithm when run in different settings and under faults, \cref{sec:evaluation:comparison} then compares the performance with our baseline \ocddiscover{} by \citeauthor{consonni}.
  \Cref{sec:evaluation:scalability} then explores further the scalability of \dodo{} across multiple nodes.

  To evaluate the performance of the different \gls{od} discovery approaches, we measure the overall runtime of the algorithm needed to compute all \glspl{od} and \glspl{ocd}.
  The runtime of the algorithm includes startup and shutdown times and the algorithm must terminate to produce a valid result.
  As a consequence, when running \dodo{} in a distributed setting, this measurement will include node discovery and shutdown synchronization times.

  All experiments were performed on homogeneous nodes with 20 cores and 64~GB of main memory.
  \dodo{} is implemented in Scala and the nodes run it with Java 1.8 with the Java JVM heap space limited to 40~GB.
  We adopted the \textit{flight\_1k} dataset available from the Information Systems Group at Hasso Plattner Institute\footnote{\url{https://hpi.de/naumann/projects/repeatability/data-profiling/fds.html}} to reduce the computation time to an order of minutes.
  This was achieved by removing sparse columns%
  \footnote{Removed columns: ArrivalDelayGroups, CancellationCode, Cancelled, CarrierDelay, CRSArrTime, DepartureDelayGroups, DepTimeBlk, Dest, DestAirportID, DestAirportSeqID, DestCityMarketID, DestCityName, DestState, DestStateFips, DestStateName, DestWac, DistanceGroup, Div1Airport, Div1AirportID, Div1AirportSeqID, Div1LongestGTime, Div1TailNum, Div1TotalGTime, Div1WheelsOff, Div1WheelsOn, Div2Airport, Div2AirportID, Div2AirportSeqID, Div2LongestGTime, Div2TailNum, Div2TotalGTime, Div2WheelsOff, Div2WheelsOn, Div3Airport, Div3AirportID, Div3AirportSeqID, Div3LongestGTime, Div3TailNum, Div3TotalGTime, Div3WheelsOff, Div3WheelsOn, Div4Airport, Div4AirportID, Div4AirportSeqID, Div4LongestGTime, Div4TailNum, Div4TotalGTime, Div4WheelsOff, Div4WheelsOn, Div5Airport, Div5AirportID, Div5AirportSeqID, Div5LongestGTime, Div5TailNum, Div5TotalGTime, Div5WheelsOff, Div5WheelsOn, DivActualElapsedTime, DivAirportLandings, DivArrDelay, DivDistance, DivReachedDest, FirstDepTime, LateAircraftDelay, LongestAddGTime, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, TaxiIn, TaxiOut, TotalAddGTime, WeatherDelay, WheelsOff, WheelsOn}.
  We ended up with a dataset consisting of 1000 rows and 36 columns: \textit{flight\_r1k\_c36}.

\subsection{Correctness and fault-tolerance}\label{sec:evaluation:correctness}

  Because we based our approach on \ocddiscover{} by \citeauthor{consonni}, we don't expect our algorithm to output a complete minimal set of \glspl{od}.
  Our goal is to output the same \glspl{ocd} and \glspl{od} than \ocddiscover{}.

  We find that for all four datasets, which we considered for comparing the results, \dodo{} computes the same \glspl{ocd} and \glspl{od} independent of whether \dodo{} is running on a single node or distributed across multiple nodes.
  We did not compare the actual results for our medium-size test dataset \textit{flight\_r1k\_c36}, because it contains too many \glspl{od}.
  But \cref{tab:results} shows, that \dodo{} finds the same number of \glspl{od} in the dataset than \ocddiscover{}.
  The number of found \glspl{od} in \cref{tab:results} indicates the sum of found \glspl{ocd} and \glspl{od}.
  \texttt{iw,jn, kfailure(s)} indicates an experiment with \dodo{} using \texttt{i} workers per node, the system consisting of \texttt{j} nodes overall and \texttt{k} nodes of them were killed during the experiment.

      \texttt{8w, 8n, 3failures} & 7 & 5 & 48~352 & 52~s \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Result comparison between \ocddiscover{}, \dodo{}, and \dodo{} in the presence of node failures.}
    \label{tab:results}
  \end{table}

  If \dodo{} experiences node failures, it redistributes the \gls{od} candidates to the remaining nodes using the state replication protocol (see \cref{protocol:stateReplication}).
  This leads to duplicate checks and along with that to the same \gls{od} being found multiple times.
  This is the case in the experiment \texttt{8w, 8n, 1failure}.
  \dodo{} finds more \glspl{od} in this experiment as there are in the dataset.
  This is due to the fact that we do not yet perform deduplication of the found \glspl{od}.

  The experiments with two and more failing nodes do not find all \glspl{od} in the dataset.
  Unfortunately, we performed the experiments manually and the first node failure was introduced before the node was able to replicate its state to the other nodes in the cluster.
  This caused the system to loose all \gls{od} candidates of this node.
  But \dodo{} was able to recover from the following node failures, because those nodes were already able to replicate their state.

  In \cref{tab:results}, we already notice that \dodo{} in a single nodes setup with eight workers is nearly 2x as fast as \ocddiscover{} with eight threads.
  Running \dodo{} on multiple nodes decreases the time even more as one would expect.
  If there are no failures, \dodo{} outputs the correct results independent of the number of nodes it is deployed on.
