\section{Approach}\label{sec:approach}
 
\subsection{OCDDISCOVER}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Idea: OD = OCD + FD
	\item Pruning rules used to build search tree
	\item Where was their mistake?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Our architecture}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Whole system
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Peer-to-peer after seednode shared data
		\item Every node holds all data
		\item Workstealing
		\item State Replication
	\end{itemize}
	\item Within every Node
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Master Worker
		\item Master holds state (Candidate queue) + does Workstealing
		\item Pull-based work distribution
		\item State Replicator for sharing and recovering states (via streaming)
		\item Data Holder for holding and sharing data (via streaming)
		\item ClusterListener to support node to node communication
		\item ResultCollector saves results to file (still need to be merged and reduced to unique results in the end)
		\item Reaper
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication Protocols}
% Questions to be answered for each one:
% What is its purpose? 
% When is the protocol started and what is the desired outcome? 
% Who is communicating? 
% What Messages are being used?
% What cases need to be covered? (Early outs etc)
