  \begin{itemize}
  	\item OCDDISCOVER
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item Idea: OD = OCD + FD
  		\item Pruning rules used to build search tree
  		\item Where was their mistake?
  	\end{itemize}
  	\item Our architecture
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item Whole system
  		\begin{itemize}
  			\item Peer-to-peer after seednode shared data
  			\item Every node holds all data
  			\item Workstealing
  			\item State Replication
  		\end{itemize}
  		\item Within every Node
  		\begin{itemize}
  			\item Master Worker
  			\item Master holds state (Candidate queue) + does Workstealing
  			\item Pull-based work distribution
  			\item State Replicator for sharing and recovering states (via streaming)
  			\item Data Holder for holding and sharing data (via streaming)
  			\item ClusterListener to support node to node communication
  			\item ResultCollector saves results to file (still need to be merged and reduced to unique results in the end)
  			\item Reaper
  		\end{itemize}
  	\end{itemize}
  	\item Communication Protocols
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item WorkStealing Protocol
  		\item Downing Protocol
  		\item StateReplication Protocol
  	\end{itemize}
  	
  \end{itemize}
