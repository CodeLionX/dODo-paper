\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

  %TODO What aspect of distribution specific challenges to focus on?

  Use same datasets as previous works for comparison (see table 6 from \citep{consonni}, was taken from HPI homepage).
  The link in the paper was broken, this is the updated one: \url{https://hpi.de/naumann/projects/repeatability/data-profiling/fds.html}.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find same number of ODs than related approaches (quality metric). If we have a gold standard: compare results to gold standard.
    \item Measure single node time (slightly higher than OCDDISCOVER)
    \item Measure scaling across columns, rows.
    \item Measure scaling across nodes (cores).
    \item Test robustness via killing nodes or jamming network.
  \end{enumerate}
