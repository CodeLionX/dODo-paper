\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
\subsection{Order Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are \glspl{od}?
	\item Why are they useful?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Query optimization
		\item Data quality (find constraints, help understand semantics)
		\item support index selection
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}	

\subsection{Order Dependency Discovery}
What are the challenges? 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Defining Minimality (Unhelpful definition of minimality in Naumann paper, incorrect one in Consonni paper)	
	\item Large searchspace (Long runtime and large memory-needs)
	\item current agorithms slow on large datasetz 
	\item Therefore need scalability -> distribution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are distributed Systems? Why are they useful?
	\item What is the actor model? Why use it here?	
\end{itemize}
