	\begin{itemize}
		\item Distribution aspect
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Why use distributed systems/ what are distributed systems? (scalabilty)
			\item Explain Nodes and Actors?
		\end{itemize}		
		\item Order Dependencies
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What are they?
			\item Why are they useful?
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Query optimization
				\item Data quality (find constraints, help understand semantics)
				\item support index selection
			\end{itemize}
			\item What are the challenges? 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Large searchspace (Long runtime and large memory-needs)
				\item Defining Minimality (Unhelpful definition of minimality in Naumann paper, incorrect one in Consonni paper)
